    <h1> Auto Insurance Shopping Tips: The Right Policy for the Lowest Rate </h1>

    <p>Insurance Step works with the top insurance
        companies across the nation. No matter what
        type of car you drive, Insurance Step will
        help you save hundreds of dollars per year.
    </p>

    <p>We have two options to save you money. Our
        form takes about a minute to fill out and
        connects you directly with insurance
        companies and insurance agents. They
        will call or email you and offer you discounts
        that are applicable to your situation. We also
        offer a self-service model, where you can get
        direct quotes on insurance company websites and
        usually buy your policy online. Where possible,
        we only show you relevant results based on your
        state, the type of insurance you are looking for,
        and any other parameters you have told us, such as
        whether or not you own a home. Our goal is to save
        you time by showing you only the most relevant offers.

    <p>While we always recommend that you speak to a
        licensed insurance agent, here are some simple
        tips that can help you save money and get the
        right policy: Shop around. This is always the
        most important tip. Every insurance company has
        its own pricing algorithms that consider a wide
        variety of factors such as age, credit, and driving
        record. No company is the cheapest or most expensive
        for all drivers. The only way you can know for sure
        what a company's rate is for your situation is to get
        a quote from that company or from one of its appointed
        agents.
    </p>

    <p>Decide what coverage you really need. For example,
        will you really need a rental car if you get into
        an accident or does your local body shop provide
        one free? Do you really want comprehensive coverage
        for your older vehicle? Do you have significant
        assets to protect that require high liability limits?
    </p>

    <p>Think carefully about your deductibles. If you drive
        cautiously and are not likely to have an accident, you
        might choose to pay a higher deductible and save money
        on your monthly premiums. On the other hand, if you must
        have your car for work and you can't save up enough money
        to pay off a high deductible, you may be better off to pay
        higher premiums for a lower deductible. Think through the
        scenarios to make sure the insurance you are buying will
        work for your situation.
